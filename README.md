The Restaurant CLI uses the Documenu API to get details of a restaurant. When you prompt the CLI, you are asked to enter the zip code and cuisine to get a list of restaurants. You can then pick a restaurant and its corresponding number to get additional details.  You also have the option to enter another zip code and cuisine to learn about more restaurants or end the program. 

The gems that need to be installed are uri, net/http, openssl, nokogiri, and json.
